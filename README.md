## üß© Project Overview
This tool is a consent-based, AES-encrypted, email-reporting keylogger designed for:

**Ethical hacking demonstrations**

**Cybersecurity education and workshops**

**Digital forensics research**

It supports real-time keystroke logging, screenshot capture, clipboard monitoring, and encrypted email reporting‚Äîwith consent verification prior to activation.

## ‚úÖ Key Features
**Feature	                Description**
Keystroke Logging	         Records all keyboard inputs along with active window titles and timestamps
Clipboard Monitoring       Monitors copy, cut, and paste activities on the system clipboard
Screenshot Capture	       Takes periodic screenshots; securely transmitted via email
AES Encryption	           Utilizes cryptography.Fernet to encrypt log data
Email Reporting	           Sends encrypted logs and screenshots via email with configurable settings
Consent Prompt	           Requires user approval before any monitoring begins
System Information	       Collects system metadata (username, IP addresses, timestamp)
Log Integrity Check	       Applies SHA256 hashing to verify log authenticity
Audit Logging	             Maintains local logs for traceability and compliance

## üêß Installation (Linux ‚Äì Ubuntu / Debian / Kali)
~~~
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y

git clone https://github.com/Riteshkumar1205/ethical-keylogger-lab.git
cd ethical-keylogger-lab

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional (for screenshot support)
sudo apt install scrot python3-tk python3-dev -y
~~~

## üì¶ Required Packages (Ensure These Are Installed)
To manually install essential Python dependencies within your virtual environment:
~~~
pip install pynput cryptography clipboard mss requests

To support active window tracking (if not already installed):

sudo apt install xdotool
~~~
## üîê Setting Environment Variables
Before executing the script, configure the necessary email variables in your terminal session:

~~~
export SENDER_EMAIL='your_email@gmail.com'
export EMAIL_PASSWORD='your_app_password'   # Use a secure App Password
export RECEIVER_EMAIL='receiver_email@gmail.com'
~~~
**Important: Do not hardcode sensitive credentials directly in the script. Always use environment variables**.

## üöÄ Running the Keylogger
To initiate the keylogger:
~~~
python keyloggers_2025.py
~~~
The script will prompt for explicit user consent.

Upon approval, it will begin capturing logs (keystrokes, clipboard data, screenshots).

Logs and captured images are encrypted and either saved locally or sent via email.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Customization
You may customize the script by modifying:

Screenshot intervals and formats

Logging frequency and batch size

Local log storage path

Email retry logic and triggers

Refer to the keyloggers_2025.py file for configuration parameters.
